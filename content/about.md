## Why Xenon?

Xenon is a programming language without a compiler at the moment. codegen and lexing are finished but thats about it. So really more.

## Is this really a good way to spend your time

No

## Will you finish Xenon

Probably

## Where can I find it

While there is no compiler avalible for Xenon at the moment, you can find the codegen and lexer on my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/ApplePieCodes) (parser is WIP).
