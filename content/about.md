## What is it?

Xenon will be a compiled programming language, with rust-like syntax. It will be memory safe, and include a better system for libraries and better tooling in general. Don't get me wrong, Rust's tooling and feature-set is amazing, that's why I'm writing Xenon in rust for now, but it is either missing some features or does things different from how I prefer it.

## Why (Not) Xenon?

Xenon is a programming language without a compiler at the moment. Code generation and lexing are finished, but that's about it.

## Is this really a good way to spend your time

No

## Will Xenon be completed?

Probably

## Where can I find it

Although there is no compiler available for Xenon at the moment, you can find the code generation and lexer on my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/ApplePieCodes). The parser is a work in progress.
