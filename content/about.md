## Why Xenon?

Xenon is a programming language without a compiler at the moment. Code generation and lexing are finished, but that's about it.

## Is this really a good way to spend your time

No

## Will Xenon be completed?

Probably

## Where can I find it

Although there is no compiler available for Xenon at the moment, you can find the code generation and lexer on my [GitHub Account](https://github.com/ApplePieCodes). The parser is a work in progress.
