title = 'How to Handle Compiler?'

I'm still debating, but for now I think the compiler for Xenon will work using the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) IR. I don't think I want to write my own compiler for each target, and having a unified platform other languages use helps in bug fixes. Also, sorry for lack of updates over the weekend. I was working on another project.
