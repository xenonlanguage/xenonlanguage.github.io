Expect an update to [xenon-codegen](https://crates.io/crates/xenon-codegen) around 3:05 to 3:30 EST today. I would push it earlier but cargo publish doesn't work on my school's WiFi. After [xenon-codegen](https://crates.io/crates/xenon-codegen) is finished, I will start implimenting the parser. Then, I will probably work on XVM.
